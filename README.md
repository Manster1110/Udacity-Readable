# Readable Content and Comment App
# Author: Steven Williams
# Developed as a project for the Udacity Professional React Developer Program

# Introduction

This is the starter project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course where you build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

To install and run this fun application, do the following:

# Getting Started

Download or Clone the project to your computer.
If you downloaded a zip file, extract the zip file to a directory of your choosing

## Installation of the Backend

In your terminal:
Change to the directory:  "project folder"\api-server

## Installation of the Frontend

ENJOY!!
